🧠 Agentic Research Workflow using DeepAgents + LangChain

This repository demonstrates an Agentic Workflow built using DeepAgents (LangChain) for automating academic research and literature synthesis.
The system consists of two specialized sub-agents that collaborate to collect, analyze, and summarize research papers.

🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how Agentic architectures can streamline the research process — from information retrieval to structured synthesis.

🧩 System Design

Research Agent:
Retrieves and compiles relevant academic papers and resources using a custom retrieval tool.

Synthesis Agent:
Extracts and organizes key insights including:

Summary

Methods

Findings

Gaps

Future Work

🔑 Key Takeaways

Modular Agent Design enhances scalability — each sub-agent can be refined independently.

Well-defined task boundaries improve output quality (defining what vs. how for each agent).

Synthesis accuracy depends on prompt structure and context handoff between agents.

Future potential: Integration of feedback loops and citation validation could enhance reliability for academic and industrial applications.

🧭 Future Directions

Integrating human-in-the-loop validation

Improving citation accuracy

Extending to domain-specific corpora (e.g., healthcare, AI ethics, climate research)

💬 Conclusion

This project reinforces the idea that AI agents aren’t just tools — they’re collaborators in knowledge discovery.
Feel free to explore, adapt, or extend this workflow for your own research automation needs.
