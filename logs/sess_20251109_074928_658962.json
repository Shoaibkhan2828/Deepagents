                    "Title": "Security Threats in Agentic AI System",

                        "Raihan Khan",

                    "Summary": "This research paper explores the privacy and security threats posed to an Agentic AI system with direct access to database systems. Such access introduces significant risks, including unauthorized retrieval of sensitive information, potential exploitation of system vulnerabilities, and misuse of personal or confidential data. The complexity of AI systems combined with their ability to process and analyze large volumes of data increases the chances of data leaks or breaches, which could occur unintentionally or through adversarial manipulation. Furthermore, as AI agents evolve with greater autonomy, their capacity to bypass or exploit security measures becomes a growing concern, heightening the need to address these critical vulnerabilities in agentic systems."

                    "Summary": "The paper explores the privacy and security threats posed by Agentic AI systems with direct database access. It highlights risks such as unauthorized data retrieval, exploitation of system vulnerabilities, and misuse of sensitive data. The complexity and data processing capabilities of AI systems increase the likelihood of data leaks, whether unintentional or through adversarial manipulation. The growing autonomy of AI agents raises concerns about bypassing or exploiting security measures, necessitating the address of these vulnerabilities.",
                    "Methods": "The paper presents a review of existing literature on AI agent architectures, risks associated with database access, the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for querying, intermediary layers and tool-based approaches for security mitigation, and ethical considerations related to AI data access.",
                    "Findings": "The paper identifies significant privacy and security risks associated with AI agents having direct database access. These risks include potential data exposure, exploitation by malicious actors, and unintended privacy violations due to the ability of AI systems to analyze large datasets.",
                    "Gaps_and_Future_Work": "The paper highlights the need for continued research in ensuring secure and responsible AI-agent interactions with databases, particularly focusing on the development of effective security measures and ethical guidelines."
